GameType: Bullet-hell SHMUP (Space Shooter/Shoot 'Em Up) for your DS

## Instructions

Copy `space_impakto.nds` to your flashcart and enjoy!

Also, try to wait for a few seconds(approximately 20 seconds) while in the main
menu to see a 1cc - 2 loop - demo.

If you don't have a DS and a flashcart, you need an emulator to play this on the
PC. Try melonDS, no$gba or DeSmuME.

## Tips

- Shoot everything that moves.
- There is always a safe area no matter how crazy the patterns are.
  Try to destroy the boss as much as possible. There is a boss timer that will
  auto destroy the boss but you won't get a score bonus this way.
- Replay is only available after 1 game( doesn't matter if you loose or not) or...
- Replay is also available when there is a saved replay on the flashcart.
- Replay is not available when you return to the main menu when the game is paused.
- Score should be a little higher with autobomb set to OFF.
- Ask around at the GBAtemp forums for the cheatz.
- If all else fails, don't move!

## Controls

You can change them with the options menu:

- B = Shoot
- A = Bomb
- R = Slowdown
